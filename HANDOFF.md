# HANDOFF

Snapshot of where the work stands, so any session or any LLM can continue. **Overwrite this file** after every decision and every finished piece of work. History goes in `_docs/log/`.

**Last updated:** 2026-11-08, by the planning session

## Current state

- Planning done. Agent docs written (`AGENTS.md`, `_docs/`).
- No code yet. GitHub repo and issues not created yet.
- Deadline: **Friday 2026-11-13** (Costa Rica time). Peer reviews of three other projects are also required to pass.

## In progress

- Nothing.

## Next up

1. Commit and push these docs to `davbaster/ai-dev-tools-project` (repo already exists).
2. Create the labels from `_docs/process.md` and the issues from the backlog seed in `_docs/plan.md` (section 11).
3. Start with issue 1 (repo scaffold).

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-08 | FastAPI + Jinja2 templates, Postgres, SQLAlchemy/Alembic, uv | Simple full stack in one language |
| 2026-11-08 | Docker Compose for the full local system, started with `make up` | Rubric: single command |
| 2026-11-08 | Render for dev and prod (web app + Postgres); full observability stack runs locally | Free tier cannot run Grafana/Tempo/Loki |
| 2026-11-08 | Cloud demo mode: admin panel shows status-code counts, has "Simulate error", and wakes the responder in-process | Demo the on-call flow without Grafana in the cloud |
| 2026-11-08 | WhatsApp share = `wa.me` link with text prefilled; user sends manually | No API needed |
| 2026-11-08 | Copy button next to WhatsApp copies title, note and URL to the clipboard | David wants to paste into email or anywhere |
| 2026-11-08 | Default categories Leer, Ver, Comprar, Compartir, Proyectos + user-created ones | User request |
| 2026-11-08 | LLM via any OpenAI-compatible API (default OpenAI) | Provider-agnostic |
| 2026-11-08 | Default `LLM_MODEL=gpt-6-luna` (OpenAI); overridable by env var | David's choice |
| 2026-11-08 | Build models: Opus 5.5 medium orchestrator, Sonnet 5.5 high engineer, Haiku 5.5 high PM and QA | Many integration-heavy tasks; strong orchestrator and engineer avoid rework before Friday |
| 2026-11-08 | Repo is `davbaster/ai-dev-tools-project` (already cloned) | Existing course repo |
| 2026-11-08 | Responder escalates with an incident marked `Needs human on-call` when it can't find the cause | User request |
| 2026-11-08 | Responder pushes fixes directly to `main` (CD deploys to dev); prod changes only via PR `main` → `prod` merged by David | David's decision: fast fixes in dev, human gate for prod |
| 2026-11-08 | Proof-of-concept testing: few tests, but unit + frontend + integration all exist | Course requires all three |
| 2026-11-08 | `AGENTS.md` is the only instruction file; `CLAUDE.md` points to it | Must work with any LLM tool |

## Open questions

- If Render's free tier allows only one free Postgres, use Neon for the second database? Decide with David when reaching issue 11 (Render blueprint).

## How to resume

Read `AGENTS.md`, this file and the newest `_docs/log/` file, then continue with "Next up".
